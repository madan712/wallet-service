## About the solution -
Swagger is added to view all the endpoints
H2 datbase is used to store data. Its a file based storage so data is persisted accross restart.
JPA is used to communicate with DB
Junit test cases are written using mockito
Spring security is used to secure the endpoints
Lombok API is used to get rid of boilerplate codes
Sonar code scan is done for quality check

Note: Lombok API is used in this project, so you may need to add Lombok plugin to your IDE if it is giving compile time error.
